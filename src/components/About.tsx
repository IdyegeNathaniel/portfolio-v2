        <p className="text-neutral-300 text-sm leading-8">
          I&#39;m a self-taught frontend developer passionate about building
          sleek, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces. What started as
          curiosity quickly evolved into a dedication to crafting intuitive
          digital experiences with modern technologies, including React,
          TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
          <br /><br />
          Along the way, I&#39;ve built real-world projects that solve real
          problems, always pushing myself to learn more, build better, and
          deliver faster.I&#39;m a proactive developer who values clear
          communication, collaboration, and clean version control through Git
          and GitHub. My approach is simple: write clean, maintainable code, pay
          attention to the details, and always keep improving.I&#39;m excited to
          join a team where I can contribute, learn from others, and build
          products that users genuinely love.
