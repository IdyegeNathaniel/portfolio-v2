          Hey! I&#39;m Nathaniel, a self-taught frontend developer with a
          genuine passion for turning ideas into clean, responsive, and
          user-friendly web experiences. What started as curiosity about how
          things work grew into a drive to build sleek, intuitive products using
          modern tools like React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
          <br />
          <br />
          I love bringing concepts to life, whether it&#39;s a full web app,
          an interactive interface, or an API integration that powers a smarter
          workflow. I&#39;ve worked on projects that solve real problems and help
          people, and I&#39;m always exploring new technologies to level up my
          skills. My approach is simple: write clean, maintainable code,
          collaborate openly, and keep improving. I&#39;m driven by the challenge of
          building things that are both creative and meaningful, the kind of
          work that makes a real impact.
