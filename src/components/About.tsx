        <p className="text-neutral-300">I&#39;m a self-taught Frontend Developer with a passion for building sleek, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces. My journey into tech started with curiosity and turned into a full-blown dedication to creating intuitive digital experiences using modern technologies like React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

          Over time, I&#39;ve built real-world projects that solve real problems — from property listing platforms to fully functional REST APIs — constantly challenging myself to learn more, build better, and ship faster. I&#39;m deeply comfortable working independently, but I also value collaboration and clean version control through Git and GitHub.

          My approach to development is simple: write clean code, pay attention to details, and always be improving. I&#39;m currently looking for opportunities where I can contribute to exciting frontend teams, grow alongside other developers, and keep creating products that users love.</p>
