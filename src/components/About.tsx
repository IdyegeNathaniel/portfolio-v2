          I&#39;m a self-taught Frontend Developer with a passion for building
          sleek, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces. My journey into
          tech started with curiosity and turned into a full-blown dedication to
          creating intuitive digital experiences using modern technologies like
          React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. Over time, I&#39;ve
          built real - world projects that solve real problems — from property
          listing platforms to fully functional REST APIs — constantly
          challenging myself to learn more, build better, and ship faster.{" "}

          <br />
          I&#39;m deeply comfortable working independently, but I also value
          collaboration and clean version control through Git and GitHub. My
          approach to development is simple: write clean code, pay attention to
          details, and always be improving.I&#39;m always looking for
          opportunities where I can contribute to exciting frontend teams, grow
          alongside other developers, and keep creating products that users
          love.
